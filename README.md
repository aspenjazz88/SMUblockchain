# SMUblockchain- Project Web3 Kickstarter

Overview: This  rpoject will be 

Some high level requirements:
1. Seller should be able to update a photo and description (metadata of his project). 
2. Seller can request the following:
- price of the item he wants to build and sell (eg. Web3 Coffee Machine- 0.05 ETH each)
- min. quantity before project starts eg. 10
- deposit to be released eg. 25% will be released to him
- he needs to have a "Completed and shipped" button
- remainder amount will be released to him once Buyer has "Received"
- Seller can choose an end date when the fundraising will close eg. 2 weeks later

3. Buyer can ideally login using his metamask
4. He can view photo and all description of project
5. He can choose to "buy" the item by releasing the price (eg. 0.05 ETH) 
6. He needs to agree with the terms and conditions, eg. deposit to be paid in advance
7. He needs to be able to click "Received" button

What we need to build
1. develop a smart contract to facilitate the above exchange including release of initial deposit and end release of full amount upon "Received"
2. a simple HTML/CSS/JS frontend
3. a web3.js or web3.py API layer
4. some integration with Metamask?  
5. For node, we can use Infura or Nodesine (our own experiemental project) :)
